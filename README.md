## About Me
I'm a 2024 Northeastern University graduate with a strong passion for Data Analysis, Engineering, and Business Intelligence. Currently, I’m pursuing my master’s in Information Systems, where I’m diving deeper into data analytics, modeling, and visualization to better understand how data shapes real-world decisions.

With a solid foundation in Python, SQL, and analytics, I enjoy working on personal projects in Data Analysis and Machine Learning, always looking for new challenges to refine my skills. Long-term, I see myself thriving in a dynamic, data-driven environment where I can contribute to meaningful projects and drive innovation.

Outside of work and academics, I enjoy exploring the outdoors and getting lost in a good book.
